# Time Input

Time input widget allows you to select start/stop time, day of week, timezone, sunrise/sunset formatted values and send them to your hardware. Supported formats for time now are `HH:MM` and `HH:MM AM/PM`.

Hardware will get selected on UI time as seconds of day \(`3600 * hours + 60 * minutes`\) for start/stop time. Time that widget sends to hardware is user local time. Selected days indexes :

```text
Monday - 1
Tuesday - 2
...
Saturday - 6
Sundays - 7
```
