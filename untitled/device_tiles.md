# Device Tiles

Device tiles is a powerful widget and very similar to the device selector widget, but with UI. It allows you to display 1 pin per device per tile. This widget is particularly helpful when you have a fleet of devices with similar functionality. So you can group similar devices within one layout \(template\).
