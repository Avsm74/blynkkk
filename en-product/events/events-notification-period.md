# Events: Notifications Limit

This setting limits the number of notifications for a specified time period.‌

Example: 1 minute period means end-users will only get one notification per 1 minute, even if hardware or API sends more.‌

Notifications Limit can be defined per each Event individually.‌

Example: If you set two Events to different Notification Limits, they will be processed independently, and end-users will get both notifications accordingly to the specified limits.
