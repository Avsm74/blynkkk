# Gravity

Gravity is kind of [motion sensors](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/sensors/sensors_motion.html) that allows you to detect motion of your smartphone. Useful for monitoring device movement, such as tilt, shake, rotation, or swing.

The gravity sensor provides a three dimensional vector indicating the direction and magnitude of gravity. Measured in `m/s^2` of gravity force applied to `x`, `y`, `z` axis.

In oder to accept data from it you need to :

```cpp
BLYNK_WRITE(V1) {
  //force of gravity applied to axis x
  int x = param[0].asFloat(); 
  //force of gravity applied to axis y
  int y = param[1].asFloat();
  //force of gravity applied to axis y
  int z = param[2].asFloat();
}
```

Gravity doesn't work in background.
