# Temperature

Temperature is kind of [environment sensors](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/sensors/sensors_environment.html) that allows you to measure ambient air temperature. Measured in `Â°C` - celcius.

In order to accept data from it you need to :

```cpp
BLYNK_WRITE(V1) {
  // temperature in celcius
  int celcius = param.asInt();
}
```

Temperature doesn't work in background.
