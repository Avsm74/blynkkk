# Proximity

Proximity is kind of [position sensors](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/sensors/sensors_position.html) that allows you to determine how close the face of a smartphone is to an object. Measured in `cm` - distance from phone face to object. However most of this sensors returns only FAR / NEAR information. So return value will be `0/1`. Where 0/LOW is `FAR` and 1/HIGH is `NEAR`.

In order to accept data from it you need to :

```cpp
BLYNK_WRITE(V1) {
  // distance to object
  int proximity = param.asInt();
  if (proximity) {
     //NEAR
  } else {
     //FAR
  }
}
```

Proximity doesn't work in background.
