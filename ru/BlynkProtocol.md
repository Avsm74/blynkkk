# Blynk protocol

Blynk transfers binary messages with the following structure:

| Command       | Message Id    | Length/Status   | Body     |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:---------------:|:--------:|
| 1 byte        | 2 bytes       | 2 bytes         | Variable |

Message Id and Length are [big endian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness#Big-endian).
Body has a command-specific format.

Command and Status definitions: [BlynkProtocolDefs.h](https://github.com/blynkkk/blynk-library/blob/master/Blynk/BlynkProtocolDefs.h)

Another protocol description can be found [here](https://github.com/blynkkk/blynk-server/blob/master/README_FOR_APP_DEVS.md#protocol-messages).

Typical Blynk library knows how to send(S)/process(P):

    S   BLYNK_CMD_LOGIN + auth token
    SP  BLYNK_CMD_PING
    SP  BLYNK_CMD_RESPONSE
    SP  BLYNK_CMD_BRIDGE
    SP  BLYNK_CMD_HARDWARE
    S   BLYNK_CMD_TWEET
    S   BLYNK_CMD_EMAIL
    S   BLYNK_CMD_PUSH_NOTIFICATION

## HARDWARE/BRIDGE command body

The body of these commands are encoded as a sequence of strings, separated by ```'\0'``` ([Null character](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_character)).
Please note that the last value may be not Null-terminated.
In the following command examples ```\0``` chars are replaced with spaces.

### Pin mode

PinMode command is received by library after connection, or when a mobile application starts.

    pm <pin> <mode>
    pm <pin> <mode> <pin> <mode> <pin> <mode> ...

Mode:

* in - INPUT
* out - OUTPUT
* pu - INPUT_PULLUP
* pd - INPUT_PULLDOWN

### Digital pin operations

Digital write:

    dw <pin> <val>

Digital read:

    dr <pin>

### Analog pin operations

    aw <pin> <val>

    ar <pin>

### Virtual pin operations

    vw <pin> <param0> <param1> <param2> <param3> ...

    vr <pin>

### Other operations

## Developer notes

* Values in HW commands are plain text.
* In response to ```dr/ar``` command, library should send ```dw/aw``` command on the same pin and with the same message id.
* These situations should cause a connection drop, or reconnection attempt:
 * Message with ```ID=0``` is received
 * Message with unknown type is received
 
## Adding network interface 
4 entities should be created to add a new network interface to Blynk:
 
1. Select connection interface that will be used for Blynk operation.  
   This should be something like http://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/WebClient  
   Based on the API of the connection, create the **Transport**.  
   Some examples may be found in the Adapters folder:
   * BlynkTransportSerial
   * BlynkTransportCC3000
   * BlynkArduinoClient - *can be reused, if possible*
   
2. Create **Blynk representative class**, which contains connection-specific helper functions (like begin).
   Examples:
   * BlynkEthernet
   * BlynkSerial
   * BlynkCC3000
   * BlynkWildFire
   * BlynkYun
   
3. Create **BlynkSimple*** header for your connection.  
   This constructs main **Blynk instance**, so the user (mostly) doesn't need to get into such details.  
   Examples:
   * BlynkSimpleEthernet.h
   * BlynkSimpleCC3000.h
   * BlynkSimpleWifi.h
   * BlynkSimpleUIPEthernet.h
   
4. Create a **simple example** for your platform ;)

### Example implementations
Use these to play with the protocol and understand the basics:

* [Node.js + Espruino](https://github.com/vshymanskyy/blynk-library-js)
* [Arduino](https://github.com/blynkkk/blynk-library)
* [Particle Core](https://github.com/vshymanskyy/blynk-library-spark)
