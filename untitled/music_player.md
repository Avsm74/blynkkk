# Music Player

Simple UI element with 3 buttons - simulates music player interface. Every button sends it's own command to hardware : `play`, `stop`, `prev`, `next`.

You can change widget state within the app from hardware side with next commands:

```text
Blynk.virtualWrite(Vx, “play”);
Blynk.virtualWrite(Vx, “stop”);
```

You can also change widget play/stop state with next code \(equivalent to above commands\) :

`Blynk.setProperty(V1, "isOnPlay", "false");`
