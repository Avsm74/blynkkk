# HTTP RESTful API

Blynk HTTP RESTful API allows to easily read and write values of Pins in Blynk apps and Hardware.  
API description can be found [here](http://docs.blynkapi.apiary.io). **Warning**: Blynk HTTP API still has GEO DNS issue. This means, for now you need to use direct server IP instead of hostname in order to make it work with 3-d party services like IFTTT.
