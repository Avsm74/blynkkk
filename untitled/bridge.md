# Bridge

Bridge can be used for Device-to-Device communication \(no app. involved\). You can send digital/analog/virtual write commands from one device to another, knowing it's auth token. At the moment Bridge widget is not required on application side \(it is mostly used for indication that we have such feature\).  
**You can use multiple bridges to control multiple devices.**

Bridge widget takes a virtual pin, and turns it into a channel to control another device. It means you can control any virtual, digital or analog pins of the target device. Be careful not to use pins like `A0, A1, A2 ...` when communicating between different device types, as Arduino Core may refer to wrong pins in such cases.

Example code for device A which will send values to device B :

```cpp
//Initiating Bridge Widget on V1 of Device A
WidgetBridge bridge1(V1);
...
void setup() {
    Blynk.begin(...);
    while (Blynk.connect() == false) {
        // Wait until Blynk is connected
    }
    bridge1.digitalWrite(9, HIGH); // will trigger D9 HIGH on Device B. No code on Device B required
    bridge1.analogWrite(10, 123);
    bridge1.virtualWrite(V1, "hello"); // you need to write code on Device B in order to receive this value. See below
    bridge1.virtualWrite(V2, "value1", "value2", "value3");
}

BLYNK_CONNECTED() {
  bridge1.setAuthToken("OtherAuthToken"); // Token of the hardware B
}
```

IMPORTANT: when performing `virtualWrite()` with Bridge Widget, Device B will need to process the incoming data from Device A. For example, if you are sending value from Device A to Device B using `bridge.virtualWrite(V5)` you would need to use this handler on Device B:

```cpp
BLYNK_WRITE(V5){
    int pinData = param.asInt(); //pinData variable will store value that came via Bridge
}
```

Keep in mind that `bridge.virtualWrite` doesn't send any value to mobile app. You need to call `Blynk.virtualWrite` for that.
