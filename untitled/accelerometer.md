# Accelerometer

Accelerometer is kind of [motion sensors](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/sensors/sensors_motion.html) that allows you to detect motion of your smartphone. Useful for monitoring device movement, such as tilt, shake, rotation, or swing. Conceptually, an acceleration sensor determines the acceleration that is applied to a device by measuring the forces that are applied to the sensor. Measured in `m/s^2` applied to `x`, `y`, `z` axis.

In order to accept data from it you need to :

```cpp
BLYNK_WRITE(V1) {
  //acceleration force applied to axis x
  int x = param[0].asFloat(); 
  //acceleration force applied to axis y
  int y = param[1].asFloat();
  //acceleration force applied to axis z
  int z = param[2].asFloat();
}
```

Accelerometer doesn't work in background.
