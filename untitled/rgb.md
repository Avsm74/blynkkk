## zeRGBa

zeRGBa is usual RGB controller \(color picker\).

### Settings:

* **SPLIT**:

  Each of the parameters is sent directly to the Pin on your hardware \(e.g D7\). You don't need to write any code.

**NOTE:** In this mode you send multiple commands from one widget, which can reduce performance of your hardware.

Example: If you have a zeRGBa Widget and it's set to D1, D2, D3 it will send 3 commands over the Internet:

```cpp
digitalWrite(1, r);
digitalWrite(2, g);
digitalWrite(3, b);
```

* **MERGE**:

  When MERGE mode is selected, you are sending just 1 message, consisting of array of values. But you'll need to parse it on the hardware. 

This mode can be used with Virtual Pins only.

Example: Add a zeRGBa Widget and set it to MERGE mode. Choose Virtual Pin V1.

```cpp
BLYNK_WRITE(V1) // zeRGBa assigned to V1 
{
    // get a RED channel value
    int r = param[0].asInt();
    // get a GREEN channel value
    int g = param[1].asInt();
    // get a BLUE channel value
    int b = param[2].asInt();
}
```

* **Send On Release** is available for most controller widgets and allows you to decrease data traffic on your hardware. 

  For example, when you move joystick widget, commands are continuously streamed to the hardware, during a single joystick move 

  you can send dozens of commands. There are use-cases where it's needed, however creating such a load may cause hardware reset. 

  We recommend enabling **Send On Release** feature for most of the cases, unless you really need instant feedback.

  This option is enabled by default.

## Write interval

Similar to above option. However, allows you to stream values to your hardware within certain interval. For example, setting write interval to 100 ms - means, that while you move slider only 1 value will be send to hardware within 100 ms. This option also used to decrease data traffic on your hardware.
