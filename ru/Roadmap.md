#Roadmap

We build Blynk based on Blynkers feedback but with limited resources we have to prioritize our features. At the moment list look like that:

- App Sharing (project sharing when other people can control your hardware, but can't modify your project); Free Beta
- App Sharing (project sharing when other people can control your hardware, but can't modify your project); Subscription based
- Bluetooth Low Energy support;
- Hardware state handling (changing physical button state changes Blynk application state);
- Hardware online/offlane state improvements (better indication for "is hardware online?", "is hardware offline?");
- Project space increase
- Direct Connect support (for WiFi);
- RTC widget;
- Design options for widgets (size, button with icons, etc);
- Phone sensors widgets (GPS, accelerometer);
- IP camera support;
- Customizable look and feel of the project

Under consideration:
- Home screen widget (to avoid opening App when you need only 1 button click);
- Haptic feedback (vibration) when touching widgets
